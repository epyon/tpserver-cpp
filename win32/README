Building for windows is really sucky, but here are the instructions anyway.

Requirements:
 * You will need the cygwin32 cross-compiler - you can get it from my blog.
 * You will need the "prebuilt" dependencies (guile, etc) - you can also get
   them from my blog. These are binaries from the cygwin archive which have
   been extracted into the /opt/crosstool/built directory.

You will also need to uninstall the libgnutls-dev and libavahi-dev packages as
the "--without-xxxx" doesn't seem to work with our ./configure script and it
picks up your system installed stuff.

You then need apply the win32.patch which will prevent a bunch of unneeded
things from building. It also disables all rulesets apart from risk and minisec.

Then run 
	./win32/build-for-windows configure
To configure and build.

Then run
	./win32/build-for-windows package
To copy the dependencies into the /opt/tpserver-cpp-win32/bin/ directory.
